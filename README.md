# N-Seccions
Code for finding the root of a function using a generalization on Bisections Method.

You need to specify the Interval that might contain the root of the function, the number of sub-intervals you want to consider in each iteration and the desired tolerance of the answer. 

a := Lower Limit. 
b := Upper Limit. 
n := Number of Divisions. 
tol := Desired Tolerance of the Answer.
